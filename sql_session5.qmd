Sales Analysis – Explanation Document


1. Revenue Overview
Total revenue of the company: Calculated using SUM(total_sales).
Revenue distribution by category: Aggregated SUM(total_sales) grouped by category.
Top category contributor: Determined by ordering total revenue descending and selecting the top category.
These queries provide insight into which products drive revenue and the overall sales scale.


2. Typical Transaction Value
Average transaction value: AVG(quantity * price) gives a general sense of transaction size.
Median transaction value: PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) provides a robust measure, especially for right-skewed data (avg > median).
Median is preferred for skewed distributions to better reflect typical transactions.


3. NULL Impact Assessment
NULL discounts: Counted with WHERE discount IS NULL.
Average discount calculation methods:
Default average
Zero imputation (COALESCE(discount, 0))
Average imputation (COALESCE(discount, AVG(discount)))
Median imputation (COALESCE(discount, PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)))
In this dataset, no NULLs exist, so method choice doesn’t affect results.

Notes:
Zero imputation is a business decision.
Average imputation preserves the mean and reduces variance.
Median imputation is robust to outliers.


4. Revenue Distribution Analysis
Revenue ranges: Transactions grouped into 50-unit bins using CEILING(total_sales/50)*50.
Metrics per range: Count of transactions (COUNT(*)) and total revenue (SUM(total_sales)) calculated for each range.
Dominant revenue range: Identified by total revenue descending within grouped ranges.
Helps visualize revenue concentration and identify typical transaction ranges.


5. Data Quality Check
Duplicate transaction IDs: Checked using GROUP BY transaction_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1.
Employee salary aggregation risk: Aggregating employee_salary may be misleading due to duplicates in the table.
Ensures that KPI calculations are reliable and highlights potential pitfalls when summing salary data directly.


✅ Summary
Revenue insights: Total and category-level contribution.
Transaction value insights: Median better represents typical transactions for skewed data.
NULL handling: Verified impact on discounts; confirmed dataset completeness.
Revenue distribution: Understanding of dominant transaction ranges.
Data quality: Identified potential risks with duplicates for accurate KPIs.
